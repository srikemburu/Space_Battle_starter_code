#### This lab is to build a rudimentary **space battle** game using my knowledge of OOP, loops, and functions. The game is programmed for, and played in the Chrome console, using pop-up prompts to get user input. This task is to **build something according to specification**.

#### A game round would look like this: 

The game starts with a prompt asking the user to attack or retreat. If user chooses to attack, the following scenario would unfold.

You attack the first alien ship - If the ship survives, it attacks you - If you survive, you attack the ship again - If it survives, it attacks you again - Etc. - If you destroy the ship, you have the option to **attack** the next ship or to **retreat** - If you retreat, the game is over. You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens. You lose the game if you are destroyed.
